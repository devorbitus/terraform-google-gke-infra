# GKE Infra

This Terraform module provisions a regional `GKE cluster`, `VPC`, and `Subnet`. Optionally, it can be configured to create a service account with limited permissions for the K8s Nodes if no `service_account` value is provided (see [Use Least Privilege Service Accounts for your Nodes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#use_least_privilege_sa)).

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that you have a version of `terraform` that is at least `v0.11.9` (run `terraform version` to validate).
2. Ensure that your `gcloud` binary is configured and authenticated:

```sh
$ gcloud auth login
```

Alternatively, you can download your `json keyfile` from GCP using [these steps](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorizing_with_a_service_account) and export the path in your environment like so:

```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=[JSON_KEYFILE_PATH]
```

3. Set google project where you'd like to deploy the cluster

```sh
export GOOGLE_PROJECT=[PROJECT_NAME]
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```

4. Setup the versioning and backend info in your `main.tf` file:

**NOTE:** these values need to be hard-coded as they cannot be interpolated as variables by Terraform.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.11.9"

  required_providers {
    google = ">= 1.19.0"
    google-beta = ">= 1.19.0"
  }

  backend "gcs" {
    bucket = "<BUCKET_NAME>"
    region = "<REGION>"
    prefix = "<PATH>"
  }
}
```

5. Setup your provider info:

**NOTE:** Google-Beta is required to enable certain features (such as private and regional clusters - see [documentation for more info](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html)).

```hcl
provider "google" {
  credentials = "${file("${var.credentials_file}")}"
  version     = "~> 1.19"
  region = "${var.region}"
}

provider "google-beta" {
  credentials = "${file("${var.credentials_file}")}"
  version     = "~> 1.19"
  region = "${var.region}"
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage Example

```hcl
module "k8s" {
  source  = "git@github.com:dansible/terraform-google_gke_infra.git?ref=v0.5.1"
  name    = "${var.name}"
  project = "${var.project}"
  region  = "${var.region}"
  private_cluster = true  # This will disable public IPs from the nodes
}
```

**NOTE:** All parameters are configurable. Please see [below](#variables) for information on each configuration option.

### Creating a Private Cluster

This module allows the creation of [Private GKE Clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters) where the nodes do not have public IP addresses. This is achieved using a [GCP Cloud NAT resource](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview?hl=en_US&_ga=2.47256615.-1497507305.1549638187).

If you were previously using the [NAT Gateway module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/GoogleCloudPlatform/nat-gateway/google/1.2.2) to create your private cluster, you will need to delete the module from your Terraform config and update this module to at least `v0.5.0`. Re-running `terraform apply` will destroy the old NAT gateway resources and spin up the Cloud NAT router.

If you would prefer to keep using the old NAT Gateway module, you can pass the [`cloud_nat` variable](variables-main.tf#L57) to this module as `false`.

### Using the Cluster as a TF Provider

In the same terraform file, you can use the cluster this module creates by adding the following resources to your `main.tf` file:

```hcl
# Pull Access Token from gcloud client config
# See: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/d/datasource_client_config.html
data "google_client_config" "gcloud" {}

provider "kubernetes" {
  load_config_file        = false
  host                    = "${module.k8s.endpoint}"
  token                   = "${data.google_client_config.gcloud.access_token}"   # Use the token to authenticate to K8s
  cluster_ca_certificate   = "${base64decode(module.k8s.cluster_ca_certificate)}"
}
```

This uses your local `gcloud` config to get an access token for the cluster. You can then create K8s resources (namespaces, deployments, pods, etc.) on the cluster from within the same Terraform plan.

### Upgrading a Cluster

The module exposes two variables to allow the separate upgrade of the control plane and nodes:

#### Update `k8s_version`

This value configures the version of the Control Plane. It needs to be upgraded first. Generally this operation takes ~15 minutes. Once that is done, re-run `terraform plan` to validate that no further changes are needed by Terraform.

#### Update `node_version`

Once the Control Plane has been updated, set this value to the Master version as you see it in GCP. You need to explicitly state the full version for the nodes (ie `1.11.5-gke.4`). If you don't provide the patch version, (ie, you only use `1.11`), this will cause a permadiff in Terraform.

Finally, run `terraform apply`, and GCP will update the nodes one at a time. This operation can take some time depending on the size of your nodepool. If you find that Terraform times out, simply wait for the operation to complete in GCP and re-run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to reconcile the state. You can supply a higher timeout value if needed (the default is 30 minutes - see [timeouts](#timeouts)).

## Workload Identity Config

Clusters will be created with Google's Workload Identity enabled in order to better secure service accounts while [authorizing to Google APIs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) because the current alternatives [have significant drawbacks](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#alternatives).

## Variables
